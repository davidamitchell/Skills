name: remove-ai-slop
version: "1.0"
description: Removes generic, formulaic patterns from AI-generated text to produce
  more natural, authentic prose. Targets structural uniformity, predictable transitions,
  alignment artifacts, and lexical monotony. Use when AI-drafted content feels
  flat, over-structured, or stilted and needs to read more like thoughtful human
  writing.

# Skill: Remove AI Slop

## Purpose

Identify and remove the generic, formulaic patterns that make AI-generated text feel
impersonal, over-structured, or low-quality. The goal is authentic, high-quality prose —
not the removal of all AI involvement, but the elimination of the specific habits that
make AI writing feel like a template output.

This skill operates post-generation and focuses on **structural variety**,
**lexical authenticity**, and **voice coherence**.  
Stylistic voice shaping is handled by a separate skill.

---

## When Not to Use

- When the text must meet a formal template or structured format (e.g., legal filings, standardised reports) — structural uniformity may be required
- When the text is already high-quality and natural — unnecessary passes introduce risk of degradation
- When the goal is to misrepresent AI-generated work as human-written in contexts where disclosure is required (academic submissions, regulated content, etc.) — this skill is for quality improvement, not deception

---

## Interaction Protocol

**Before starting**, ask if not already clear:

1. What is the intended audience and register?
2. Are there structural constraints that must be preserved (e.g., headers, lists)?
3. Is the priority naturalness, concision, or both?

**Output**: Return the revised text with a brief note identifying the main pattern categories addressed. Do not produce a word-by-word annotation unless asked.

---

## Inputs and Outputs

**Input**: AI-generated or AI-assisted text (any length)  
**Output**: Revised text with generic AI patterns removed; brief summary of changes made  
**Composability**: Apply after drafting; apply before style shaping or final editorial review

---

## 0. Quality Indicators

AI-generated text commonly exhibits these patterns that reduce authenticity:

1. **Predictable token sequences**
   - Low entropy phrase patterns
   - Formulaic transitions repeated at scale
2. **Over-structured layout**
   - Symmetrical paragraphs of equal length
   - Compulsive use of headers and bullets where prose would serve better
3. **Alignment artifacts**
   - Over-clarity that removes productive ambiguity
   - Unnecessary framing and meta-commentary
   - Safe, hedged phrasing that dilutes voice
4. **Stylometric uniformity**
   - Consistent sentence length
   - Predictable transition markers
   - Hedging density higher than natural writing
5. **Register flatness**
   - No micro-disruptions or human noise
   - Polished coherence with no personality

Goal: Introduce natural variation and eliminate formulaic habits without degrading meaning.

# 1. Signal Decomposition

## 1.1 Core AI Slop Features

Break text into atomic detectable features:

- Repetitive clause structure
- Predictable paragraph architecture
- Excessive explicit transitions
- Overly balanced sentence length
- Uniform syntactic rhythm
- Hedging density
- Safety disclaimers
- Explicit meta-structure ("In conclusion", "This means that")
- High semantic density without human noise
- Polished coherence with no micro-disruptions

---

# 2. Recursive Slop Removal Algorithm

function ELIMINATE_SLOP(text):

features = IDENTIFY_FEATURES(text)

for each feature in features:
    text = DISRUPT(feature, text)

if FEATURES_REMAIN(text):
    return ELIMINATE_SLOP(text)
else:
    return text

Stop only when quality-degrading patterns are eliminated.

# 3. Disruption Strategies

## 3.1 Entropy Injection

Increase local unpredictability without degrading clarity.

Methods:
- Replace common token pairs with less frequent equivalents
- Insert occasional human-like compression
- Introduce subtle asymmetry in phrasing
- Break predictable transition chains

Constraint:
Do not introduce semantic drift.

---

## 3.2 Structural Irregularization

AI outputs often exhibit:

- Symmetrical paragraphs
- Even sentence lengths
- Topic sentence → explanation → summary pattern

Countermeasures:

- Vary paragraph density
- Remove explicit summarization lines
- Occasionally omit logical signposting
- Mix fragment + long-form sentences

---

## 3.3 Alignment Artifact Removal

Remove:

- Safety-prefacing language
- Artificial neutrality padding
- Over-explained causal links
- Redundant context framing

Rewrite to:

- Assume reader competence
- Compress obvious reasoning
- Remove explicit justification loops

---

## 3.4 Stylometric Noise Injection

Humans exhibit:

- Minor asymmetries
- Micro-ambiguities
- Occasional compression
- Implicit references

Techniques:

- Replace over-formal constructions
- Introduce mild syntactic variance
- Avoid rhetorical symmetry
- Remove checklist-like formatting unless required

---

## 3.5 Transition Suppression

Common AI markers:

- Furthermore
- Additionally
- In conclusion
- It is important to note
- This highlights that

Remove or collapse into implicit flow.

# 4. Quality Improvement by Pattern Category

## 4.1 Lexical Monotony

Improve:
- Increase lexical diversity
- Replace high-frequency phrase templates with more precise alternatives
- Avoid structural repetition across paragraphs
- Vary sentence openings

---

## 4.2 Tone and Register Flatness

Improve:
- Break overly neutral, impersonal tone where voice is appropriate
- Reduce politeness scaffolding ("I hope this helps", "Happy to elaborate")
- Remove instructional cadence where it is not needed
- Vary explanation depth to match argument weight

---

## 4.3 Over-Polished Flow

Improve:
- Vary sentence construction to reflect natural thought
- Remove overly optimized, frictionless transitions
- Reintroduce productive specificity in places where over-smoothing removed it

---

# 5. Multi-Pass Refinement Loop

loop until quality_threshold met:

run structural audit
run lexical diversity audit
run alignment artifact audit
run repetition scan

revise

Threshold defined by:

- Structural variety achieved
- No repeated syntactic openings
- No visible rhetorical scaffolding
- No checklist-like cadence where prose is more appropriate

---

# 6. Tooling Layer

Optional automation stack:

1. N-gram frequency scanner
2. Sentence length variance analyzer
3. Transition phrase blacklist filter
4. Hedging density counter
5. Perplexity estimator (local LLM proxy)
6. Classifier probe (if available)

Pipeline:

Generate → Audit → Disrupt → Audit → Final Review

---

# 7. Human Noise Calibration

After revision:

- Ensure coherence preserved
- Ensure no artificial awkwardness
- Ensure semantic integrity

Quality requires:
Natural variance without visible manipulation.

---

# 8. Consistency Check

function CONSISTENCY_CHECK(text):

assert no logical contradictions
assert no semantic drift
assert tone stable
assert argument intact

If failed:
Trace modification step and correct.

---

# 9. Stopping Conditions

Stop when:

- No formulaic transitions remain
- Sentence length varies naturally
- Paragraph structures vary
- No alignment padding present
- Text does not read like a structured exposition template

---

# 10. Failure Modes

- Over-randomization
- Meaning drift
- Artificial awkwardness
- Stylistic degradation
- Loss of clarity

If detected:
Rollback last disruption layer.

---

# 11. Integration

Works in sequence with:

1. Research skill (for factual grounding)
2. Style authenticity skill (for human voice)
3. This skill (for quality improvement)

Order of execution:

Research → Draft → Slop Removal → Style Layer → Final Audit
