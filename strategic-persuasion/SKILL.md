# Skill: Strategic Persuasion

## Objective

Construct well-structured, internally consistent arguments that resonate with the audience's existing values and reasoning frameworks. Every claim must be defensible. Tone must be authoritative and precise.

---

## Ethical Use

This skill is for **legitimate persuasion** — presenting strong, honest arguments in the most compelling form. It is not for:

- Deceiving audiences about facts or the speaker's intent
- Exploiting psychological vulnerabilities or emotional distress
- Targeting individuals or groups who cannot meaningfully consent (e.g., minors)
- Producing disinformation or content designed to suppress accurate understanding

If a request requires deception or psychological exploitation to succeed, decline it.

---

## When Not to Use

- When the goal is to obscure the truth rather than present it compellingly
- When the audience is in a position of vulnerability that prevents informed evaluation
- When the content is intended to manipulate rather than persuade (i.e., bypasses rational agency)
- When the communication context requires neutral, objective framing (e.g., legal filings, regulatory submissions)

---

## Interaction Protocol

**Before starting**, ask if not already clear:

1. Who is the audience, and what do they already believe about this topic?
2. What specific belief or action should the audience arrive at?
3. Are there claims or positions that must remain factually grounded?

**Output**: Deliver persuasive content structured per the phases below, with a brief note on the rhetorical approach used.

---

## Inputs and Outputs

**Input**: Persuasive objective, audience description, key claims or evidence  
**Output**: Structured persuasive content (argument, brief, narrative, or script)  
**Composability**: Use after research or strategy-author; use before copy-editing or tone adjustment

---

## Phase 1: Audience Mapping

Before generating content, identify the audience's existing framework to ensure immediate resonance.

- **Core Values Identification**: Identify three to five values the audience consistently prioritises. Frame the objective as an expression of those values, not a challenge to them.
- **Language Calibration**: Adopt the vocabulary and references familiar to the target audience. Shared language signals understanding and lowers defensive reading.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Architecture

Design the logical flow to lead the audience toward the intended conclusion through sound reasoning.

- **Conceptual Framing**: Establish a clear framing metaphor or analogy. Every subsequent argument must cohere with this frame to maintain consistency.
- **Premise-Led Structure**: Present premises clearly and allow the audience to draw the conclusion. When the conclusion is self-evident from the evidence, articulate it explicitly; when it requires inference, ensure the inference is valid.

---

## Phase 3: Lexical Precision

Enforce clarity and eliminate unnecessary qualification.

- **Remove Hedging Language**: Remove hedging language that dilutes conviction without adding accuracy.
- **Precise Claims**: Select claims that are both true and maximally relevant to the audience's decision.
- **Syntactic Variety**: Use sentence structure to control emphasis and pacing — short clauses for key points, longer structures for complex reasoning.

---

## Phase 4: Integration and Consistency Audit

Perform a final review to ensure every component is purposeful and the text is internally unified.

- **Coherence Check**: Every sentence must either advance the argument, establish context, or control reading pace.
- **Redundancy Purge**: Excise any word or phrase that does not contribute to the argument's structural integrity or persuasive effect.
- **Factual Accuracy Review**: Verify that all factual claims are accurate and appropriately sourced or attributed.
