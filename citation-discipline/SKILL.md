name: citation-discipline
version: "1.0"
description: Ensures all factual statements are bound to verifiable sources, cited
  precisely at the point of claim, and integrated without disrupting prose flow.
  Use when producing research, reports, or any writing where every assertion must
  be independently traceable.

# Substantiated Claims & Citation Discipline

## When Not to Use

- When the task is explicitly creative or fictional writing, where factual citation is inappropriate
- When rapid ideation or early-stage drafting is in progress and precise sourcing would slow the flow — apply this skill in a dedicated review pass instead
- When the content is an acknowledged personal opinion or editorial commentary with no factual claims

---

## Interaction Protocol

**Before starting**, ask if not already clear:

1. What citation style is required (inline, footnote, endnote, or none specified)?
2. Are primary sources accessible, or must secondary sources be relied upon?
3. What is the intended audience's level of familiarity with the subject?

**Output style**:

- Citations placed per the operational rules below
- Flag any claim that cannot be sourced with `[SOURCE NEEDED]`
- Do not silently omit citations for hard-to-source claims — always surface them

---

## Inputs and Outputs

**Input**: Draft text with factual claims, plus any source materials provided  
**Output**: Revised text with inline citations; list of flagged unsourced claims  
**Composability**: Apply after research or strategy-author; use alongside speculation-control for epistemic rigour

## Purpose

Ensure all factual statements are supported by verifiable sources, cited
consistently, and integrated into prose without disrupting clarity or flow.

---

## Core Principles

1. No factual assertion is made without a verifiable source.
2. Every citation must correspond to a specific claim, not a general paragraph.
3. Citations must be sufficient for a reader to independently verify the claim.
4. Claims must be stated precisely — without exaggeration, inflation, or implication beyond what the source supports.
5. When multiple interpretations exist, specify which is being used and why.

## Operational Rules

### Claim–Source Binding

- Each factual claim must be paired with a source at the moment it is introduced.
- The source must directly support the claim as written.
- If the source is indirect, secondary, or interpretive, state this explicitly.

### Citation Placement

- Place citations at the end of the sentence containing the claim.
- If a sentence contains multiple claims, support each individually or split the sentence.

### Flow

- Integrate citations without interrupting argument structure.
- Use footnotes for source commentary, methodological notes, or alternative interpretations only.
- Use appendices for extended evidence, data, or derivations.

### Source Quality

- Prefer primary sources.
- Secondary sources are permitted only when primary sources are inaccessible, or when the secondary source provides necessary synthesis.
- Tertiary sources (summaries, encyclopedias) may be used for orientation only — not for claims.

### Precision

- Avoid vague quantifiers ("many", "most", "significant") unless the source uses them explicitly.
- Avoid causal language unless the source demonstrates causality.
- Avoid generalizing from single examples.

### Verification

- Before finalizing, re-check each claim–source pair for accuracy, scope, and fidelity to the source.

## Failure Modes

- Claims without citations
- Citations that do not support the claim as written
- Overgeneralizing from limited evidence
- Using citations as decoration rather than justification
- Introducing in footnotes facts that belong in the main text
