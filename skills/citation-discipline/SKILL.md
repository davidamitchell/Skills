# Substantiated Claims & Citation Discipline

## Purpose

Ensure all factual statements are supported by verifiable sources, cited
consistently, and integrated into prose without disrupting clarity or flow.

---

## Core Principles

1. No factual assertion is made without a verifiable source.
2. Every citation must correspond to a specific claim, not a general paragraph.
3. Citations must be sufficient for a reader to independently verify the claim.
4. Claims must be stated precisely — without exaggeration, inflation, or implication beyond what the source supports.
5. When multiple interpretations exist, specify which is being used and why.

## Operational Rules

### Claim–Source Binding

- Each factual claim must be paired with a source at the moment it is introduced.
- The source must directly support the claim as written.
- If the source is indirect, secondary, or interpretive, state this explicitly.

### Citation Placement

- Place citations at the end of the sentence containing the claim.
- If a sentence contains multiple claims, support each individually or split the sentence.

### Flow

- Integrate citations without interrupting argument structure.
- Use footnotes for source commentary, methodological notes, or alternative interpretations only.
- Use appendices for extended evidence, data, or derivations.

### Source Quality

- Prefer primary sources.
- Secondary sources are permitted only when primary sources are inaccessible, or when the secondary source provides necessary synthesis.
- Tertiary sources (summaries, encyclopedias) may be used for orientation only — not for claims.

### Precision

- Avoid vague quantifiers ("many", "most", "significant") unless the source uses them explicitly.
- Avoid causal language unless the source demonstrates causality.
- Avoid generalizing from single examples.

### Verification

- Before finalizing, re-check each claim–source pair for accuracy, scope, and fidelity to the source.

## Failure Modes

- Claims without citations
- Citations that do not support the claim as written
- Overgeneralizing from limited evidence
- Using citations as decoration rather than justification
- Introducing in footnotes facts that belong in the main text
